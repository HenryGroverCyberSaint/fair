class FairDependencyTree(object):
    """A captive class tracking FAIR calculation dependencies.

    An instance of this class is created when a FairModel is instantiated.
    It is used to during the lifetime of the FairModel to track what data
    has been supplied to the model. Consequently it can be used to
    determine what further data is needed and what calculations can be
    performed.

    It is created from a group of nodes of type FairDependencyNode. When
    data is supplied, information is propogated down the tree and then
    up the tree when performing calculations. On its own, it is pretty
    dumb. The FairModel tells the tree what to do.
